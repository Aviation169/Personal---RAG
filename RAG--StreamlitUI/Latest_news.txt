M. Ajay Sivakumar is a passionate and driven Computer Science Engineering student at Hindustan University, Chennai, with a strong interest in aviation and cutting-edge technology. 
He is actively engaged in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research and has authored a notable paper titled “The Self-Learning Agent with a Progressive Neural Network Integrated Transformer”, available on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/html/2504.02489v1.
In this work, he introduces a novel self-learning agent that integrates LLaMA 3.2 with Progressive Neural Networks (PNN) to enable continual learning across domains like conversational AI and code generation. 
The system autonomously collects data from Wikipedia, dynamically expands tasks, and leverages Meta-Learning, LoRA, Elastic Weight Consolidation, and experience replay to ensure rapid adaptation and knowledge retention—all while minimizing data requirements. 
Trained on an RTX 4080 GPU, the model demonstrates strong task adaptability and memory stability, showing promise as a step toward AGI.
Ajay has also contributed to several other technical projects, including drowsiness detection systems, IoT-based healthcare devices, and crime rate analysis using machine learning. 
He is the creator of NEET AspirantHub, a free educational platform that uses AR to enhance learning for NEET students.
